Lending system, written in TotalJS

The web app that we want to develop is a Lending Library.
* Provide a list of books
* Provide a list of users
* Ability to add a new book
* Check out a book to somebody
* Waiting lists for books
* No authentication is required.
* UI presentation not important - its more to see how it is implemented.
* Unit tests
* Standard build script and CI rules.
